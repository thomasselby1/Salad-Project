Salad Project
The Salad Project, as we envision it, is an application designed to make it easy for users to design and order healthy salads in an informative and calculated way.  We believe that this can be turned into a real business here in New Haven with relatively low startup costs. 
The app is designed to provide salads that meet the nutritional and caloric needs of the user, as determined by a dietician and optimized by a workout schedule and physical activity.  The way it works is that a user would have a profile in which the user would input physical activity data - with the support of a dietician if desired, or for a basic test case a simple rubric – and desired caloric and nutritional inputs.  The system would then output a salad designed to help the individual meet his or her nutritional goals that would be created and delivered to a central repository, potentially the food truck locations near the Yale Whale.
Business Plan
The plan is currently to set up and execute a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) pilot here in New Haven, targeting our friends at various graduate schools at Yale.  We envision selling subscriptions for various levels, beginning perhaps at 3 salads per week and increasing to include smoothies and other healthy foods and snacks.
When a user signs up they will automatically receive a quick and easy 15 minute consultation with a certified dietician in order to evaluate their current health status, fitness and nutritional goals.  Plans can be tailored in a number of ways, including weight loss, muscle gain, increased nutritional intake, etc.
In conjunction with user input, the dietician will then prescribe a diet, which can be as specific as needed: calories per meal, calories per day, meals per day, protein and fat percentage per meal and any other restrictions such as gluten free, dairy free, food allergies etc.
This input information will then serve as optimization constraints for the customer’s food.  We envision starting with salads, but intend to expand – as described above – to include smoothies, breakfast, dinner, snacks and other menu items.  The pickup point will be a vending machine that acts as a food pick up locker. This makes the delivery process much easier. The customer will go to a vending machine located close to their normal lunch location, scan a code from their phone and their personal meal will be dispensed.
The MVP
The MVP pilot will consist of the sale of 100 salad subscriptions at $8/per salad including 3-5 salads per week which would total between $2,400 and $4,000 of revenue.  A friend of the founding teams is a current student at the school of public health and certified dietician, and has committed to giving the consultations and recording and entering data into our system.  Based on the information entered and user input, salads would be created and produced, providing that all orders were received by 10 am to allow time for logistics.  
Salads would be created using a scale to measure the ingredients and comply with the diet plan.  One member of the founding team, Dan Freed, has years of experience in high level food service and could easily prepare 100 salads in two hours.  We would then organize a pick up table and schedule at a convenient location, most likely near the food carts. 
If the pilot was successful, with repeat orders, over a period of a few weeks we would have the confidence to If we can successfully run this operation for one month then we could look at ways to expand. Even without high volume, this would be a profitable business with 100 subscribers.
